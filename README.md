  Adding multiple habits to track like reading a book, going to the gym etc
  Track each habit everyday. These are the 3 statuses of a habit:
       Done - Mark the habit as done for a day
       Not done - Mark the habit as not done for a day
       None - User did not take any action on a habit for a day
2. A view to show all current habits. Here give an add button where you can add a new habit to track.


3. A view to display 7 days of each habit
      Show today where user can mark todays habit
      And show the previous 6 days and the status of that habit for each day
      A user can toggle between the three (above mentioned) statuses of a habit i.e. I can change todayâ€™s status as done, not done or none anytime.
      Also I should be able to change any of the previous days status i.e. I can change the status of a habit for yesterday, day before yesterday or any previous 6 days as well
